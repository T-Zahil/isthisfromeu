# IsThisFromEU

A community-driven initiative to catalog brands and their European alternatives. This project aims to help consumers make informed choices by providing information about brands and suggesting European alternatives.

## About the Project

This is currently a prototype built with static data stored in YAML files. The project's future development will depend on community interest and feedback. If the community finds it valuable, we may evolve towards a more robust solution with a proper database and/or CMS. We could even publish it as a mobile app!

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) (A Vue.js meta-framework)
- **Hosting**: Hetzner (Germany)
- **Domain**: OVH (France)
- **Version Control**: GitHub

> **Note**: While the project is currently hosted on GitHub (a non-European platform), this choice was made to maximize community participation. We are open to discussing alternative hosting solutions in the future.
